# FAIRSCAPE Demos

[Spark](https://github.com/fairscape/Spark-Demo) and [Nypipe](https://github.com/fairscape/Nipype-Demo).
Both demos cover the basic principles of FAIRSCAPE such as uploading data, viewing metadata, and running computations.

## Outline

Below is the topics covered in both demos.

 1. Upload data to the FAIRSCAPE framework
 2. Check metadata for an uploaded object
 3. Upload a workflow to run on the uploaded data
 4. Run the uploaded workflow on the on the uploaded data
 5. Review the identifiers of the outputs of the workflow
 6. View evidence graph of an output from the workflow
 7. Visualize evidence graph of an ouput from a workflow

## Differences

The demos cover two different use cases one utilizes spark on kubernetes to perform analysis on large amounts of data, the nypipe demo covers how to run a nypipe
workflow and visualize the proveance of outputs from the workflow.
