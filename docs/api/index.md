FAIRSCAPE auto-generates reference documentation using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), the modern Web framework for building APIs with
Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints.

- **[FAIRSCAPE REST docs UI](https://fairscape.net/api/docs)**: It is provided by
  [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) and allows a client to use `Try it out` button to run operations
  on the endpoints.
