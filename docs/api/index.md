FAIRSCAPE auto-generates reference documentation using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), the modern Web framework for building APIs with 
Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints. The API is published in two interactive forms:

- **[FAIRSCAPE REST docs UI](https://fairscape.pods.uvarc.io/docs)**: It is provided by 
[Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) and allows a client to use `Try it out` button to run operations
on the endpoints.
- **[FAIRSCAPE REST ReDoc UI](https://fairscape.pods.uvarc.io/redoc)**: It is provided by 
[ReDoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) offering a three panel responsive layout containing a search bar on the left, 
documentation in the middle, and request and response examples on the right.
