# Welcome to FAIRSCAPE

"This article describes FAIRSCAPE, a reusable computational framework, enabling simplified access to modern scalable 
cloud-based components. FAIRSCAPE fully implements the FAIR data principles and extends them to provide fully FAIR 
Evidence, including machine-interpretable provenance of datasets, software and computations, as metadata for all 
computed results. The FAIRSCAPE microservices framework creates a complete Evidence Graph for every computational 
result, including persistent identifiers with metadata, resolvable to the software, computations, and datasets used in 
the computation; and stores a URI to the root of the graph in the resultâ€™s metadata. An ontology for Evidence Graphs, 
EVI ([https://w3id.org/EVI](https://w3id.org/EVI)), supports inferential reasoning over the evidence."
