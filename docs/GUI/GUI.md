# FAIRSCAPE GUI

The FAIRSCAPE Electron App provides a user-friendly interface for packaging research objects and validating metadata, making it easier than ever to ensure your research data is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

## Features

- **RO-Crate Creation**: Easily create Research Object Crates (RO-Crates) to package your research data with its associated metadata.
- **Metadata Registration**: Register and manage metadata for your research objects through user-friendly forms.
- **Schema Description**: Describe the schema of tabular datasets.
- **Step-by-Step Workflow**: Navigate through the process of creating, packaging, and uploading your research objects with our guided interface.
