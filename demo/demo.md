# FAIRSCAPE Demos
[Python (using custom container)](https://fairscape.github.io/demo/python.html),
[Spark](https://fairscape.github.io/demo/spark-demo.html) and [Nypipe](https://fairscape.github.io/demo/nypipe-demo.html).
All demos cover the basic principles of FAIRSCAPE such as uploading data, viewing metadata, and running computations. The python example demo is published at deepnote and may be viewed and run [HERE](https://deepnote.com/@justin-niestroy/Python-Sample-Demo-HGkR1ke1RXiEmtxJ-1HIEw).

## Outline

Below is the topics covered in all demos.

 1. Upload data to the FAIRSCAPE framework
 2. Check metadata for an uploaded object
 3. Upload a workflow/script to run on the uploaded data
 4. Run the uploaded workflow/script on the on the uploaded data
 5. Review the identifiers of the outputs of the workflow
 6. View evidence graph of an output from the workflow
 7. Visualize evidence graph of an ouput from a workflow

## Differences

The demos cover three different use cases the first demo shows how a user can write a script in the language of their choosing and run it using any container they would like, the second utilizes spark on kubernetes to perform analysis on large amounts of data, the nypipe demo covers how to run a nypipe workflow and visualize the proveance of outputs from the workflow.
